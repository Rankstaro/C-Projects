# C++ Projects
## Summary
In this repository is the source code and specifications for numerous exercises and projects that I've 
undertaken in the past. Advanced Programming and Algorithms + Data Structures was completed during my 
second year, while OpenCL and OpenGL were completed in the third. If you wish to run the code, I've also
included the tutorials on setting up the environment. :)
