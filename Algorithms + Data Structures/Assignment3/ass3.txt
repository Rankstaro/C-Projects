RESULTS:
The results for Djikstras algorithm were initially confusing, as I did not know how to 
properly output the correct data! Eventually I realised that my algorithm was correct,
and that I merely needed to construct the path using child = parent[child] in a loop, 
starting from the end vertex. This set back caused me to be unable to complete the
Assignment in full.
For the sample data provided the results were:
Length: 8.5 
	The value of D(endv), where endv is the ending vertex
Path: 16, 8, 4, 19
Additional Selected: 13
	A count from array S but ignore all S which are in the Path or -1 valued.

Efficiency:
Method 1:
O(|V|2 + |E|)
For each vertex w in Candidate set C within reach of the current vertex v,
the minimum D(w) is added to the D array. This involves two linear searches.
Method 2:
Can be the same in terms of effeciency as method 1, however it can also improve
efficiency.
Method 3:
O(|V|.log|V|+|E|)

 
Problems that may arise
Method 1:
Worst case- Djikstras algorithm will perform many operations as it branches out.
